# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction-and-Analysis-using-Regression-and-Clustering-Techniques

-	This project was an attempt to uncover insights on consumer behavior against various products on Black Friday which in turn affects the total purchase made at a store. 
- We used regression techniques like Linear Regression and Random Forest for the prediction of total purchase and K â€“ means Clustering to segment the data into a set of homogenous clusters of records for generating the insight of how many people belonged to each city and how that ranked in terms of total purchase. 
- The project was particularly helpful to both stores as well as e-commerce businesses as they can get a better understanding on which products are making the most money with what sectors of the buyers. This in turn can help the retail brands to identify their target audience as well as position and market their products better.
